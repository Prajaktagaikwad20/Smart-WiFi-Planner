# Smart-WiFi-Planner
“Campus WiFi Planner using Greedy Algorithm"
This project implements a Campus WiFi Planner using the Greedy algorithm to efficiently place WiFi routers across a campus. The goal is to maximize coverage while minimizing the number of routers and cost.

Key Features:
Uses Greedy approach to select optimal router locations.
Ensures maximum area coverage with minimum overlap.
Simulates real-world campus environment with multiple buildings and obstacles.
Outputs router placement map and coverage statistics.

Technologies / Tools Used:
Programming Language: HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT
Algorithm Concepts: Greedy algorithm, Prims algorithm, Optimization

Use Case:
Useful for IT administrators and network planners in colleges and offices to efficiently plan WiFi networks.
